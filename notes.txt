This is supposed to be a space-cyber shooter. Like Tron. There really is no
story in the game. There is a single gun, but it has 3 modes of fire and
unlimited ammo. The objective of the game is just to survive wave after wace
and unlock new areas of the map like CoD: Zombies. The enemy creatures and the
environment should have a low-poly look. They do not need to be textured.
There will also be nice filters over everything so that it looks more
artistic. When the player takes damage the screen will glitch out on
progrssively become worse. There will be a settings menu where the player can
choose want filter style they want: Win92, AppleII, Commodore64, and so on.
The music she be background wubs, like "Violence (Alternate)" and 
"Ultraviolence" from the Doom (2016) OST but replace the guitar riffs with some
electronic instrument. The game throws your right into the action from the
start. When you die you are shown how long you lived "Time Compiled:" and how
many enemies you destroyed "Terrums Defractured:". The enemies are called
Terums. This is because they are not from Earth (the name means the opposite I
know). The map is all on giant spheres, like mini planets, and the player's
gravity is tied to them. Progressive maps have more obstacles. When a map is
cleared, a one-way portal to the next one appears and the player continues on.
The skybox is always stars.
